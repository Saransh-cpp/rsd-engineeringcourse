# ## Functional programming

# %% [markdown]
# We have previously seen the object-oriented style of programming, and how to organise our code according to it using objects, classes and inheritance. While widely-adopted and very useful, this is not the only way of writing code. The [*functional paradigm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), as the name suggests, emphasises functions as building blocks of programs.
#
# Understanding to think in a functional programming style is almost as
# important as object orientation for building DRY, clear scientific software,
# and is just as conceptually difficult.
# However, being aware of different paradigms and styles gives you access to more techniques that you can use to write, structure and reason about your code.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Functions within functions

# %% [markdown]
# Programs are composed of functions: they take data in (which we call
# *parameters* or *arguments*) and send data out (through `return` statements).
#
# A conceptual trick which is often used by computer scientists to teach the core
# idea of functional programming is this: to write a program,
# in theory, you only ever need functions with **one** argument, even when you think you need two or more. Why?
#
# Let's define a program to add two numbers:
#
#
#

# %%
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(5, 6)


# %% [markdown]
#
#
# How could we do this, in a fictional version of Python which only defined functions of one argument?
# In order to understand this, we'll have to understand several of the concepts
# of functional programming. Let's start with a program which just adds five to
# something:
#
#
#

# %%
def add_five(a):
    return a + 5

add_five(6)


# %% [markdown]
#
#
# OK, we could define lots of these, one for each number we want to add. But that
# would be infinitely repetitive. So, let's try to metaprogram that: we want a
# function which returns these add_N() functions.
#
# Let's start with the easy case: a function which returns a function which adds 5 to something:
#
#
#

# %%
def generate_five_adder():
    def _five_adder(a):
        return a + 5
    return _five_adder

coolfunction = generate_five_adder()
coolfunction(7)


# %% [markdown]
#
#
# OK, so what happened there? Well, we defined a function **inside** the other function. We can always do that:
#
#
#

# %%
def thirty_function():
    def times_three(a):
        return a * 3
    def add_seven(a):
        return a + 7
    return times_three(add_seven(3))

thirty_function()

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# When we do this, the functions enclosed inside the outer function are **local** functions, and can't be seen outside:
#
#
#

# %%
add_seven

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# There's not really much of a difference between functions and other variables
# in python. A function is just a variable which can have () put after it to call
# the code!
#
#
#

# %%
print(thirty_function)

# %%
x = [thirty_function, add_five, add]

# %%
for fun in x:
    print(fun)


# %% [markdown]
#
#
# And we know that one of the things we can do with a variable is `return` it. So we can return a function, and then call it outside:
#
#
#

# %%
def deferred_greeting():
    def greet():
        print("Hello")
    return greet

friendlyfunction = deferred_greeting()

# %%
# Do something else
print("Just passing the time...")

# %%
# OK, Go!
friendlyfunction()


# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# So now, to finish this, we just need to return a function to add an arbitrary amount:
#
#
#

# %% [markdown]
# <div id="generate_adder"></div>

# %%
def generate_adder(increment):
    def _adder(a):
        return a + increment
    return _adder

add_3 = generate_adder(3)

# %%
add_3(9)

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# We can make this even prettier: let's make another variable pointing to our define_adder() function:
#
#
#

# %%
add = generate_adder

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# And now we can do the real magic:
#
#
#

# %%
add(8)(5)

# %% [markdown]
# In summary, we have started with a function that takes two arguments (`add(a, b)`) and replaced it with a new function (`add(a)(b)`). This new function takes a single argument, and returns a function that itself takes the second argument.
#
# This may seem like an overly complicated process - and, in some cases, it is! However, this pattern of functions that return functions (or even take them as arguments!) can be very useful. In fact, it is the basis of decorators, a Python feature that we will discuss more [in this chapter](./025Iterators.html#Decorators) [[notebook](./025Iterators.ipynb#Decorators)].

# %% [markdown]
# ### Closures

# %% [markdown]
# You may have noticed something a bit weird:
#
# In the definition of [`generate_adder`](#generate_adder), `increment` is a local variable. It should have gone out of scope and died at the end of the definition. How can the amount the returned adder function is adding still be kept?
#
# This is called a **closure**. In Python, whenever a function definition references a variable in the surrounding scope, it is preserved within the function definition.
#
# You can close over global module variables as well:
#
#
#

# %%
name = "Eric"

def greet():
    print("Hello, ", name)

greet()

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# And note that the closure stores a reference to the variable in the surrounding scope: ("Late Binding")
#
#
#

# %%
name = "John"

greet()

# %% [markdown]
# ### Map and Reduce

# %% [markdown]
# We often want to apply a function to each variable in an array, to return a new array. We can do this with a list comprehension:
#
#
#

# %%
numbers = range(10)

[add_five(i) for i in numbers]

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# But this is sufficiently common that there's a quick built-in:
#
#
#

# %%
list(map(add_five, numbers))


# %% [markdown]
#
#
# This **map** operation is really important conceptually when understanding
# efficient parallel programming: different computers can apply the *mapped*
# function to their input at the same time. We call this Single Program, Multiple
# Data (SPMD). **map** is half of the [**map-reduce**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) functional programming
# paradigm which is key to the efficient operation of much of today's "data
# science" explosion. 
#
# Let's continue our functional programming mind-stretch by looking at **reduce** operations.
#
# We very often want to loop with some kind of accumulator (an intermediate result that we update), such as when finding a mean:
#
#
#

# %%
def summer(data):
    total = 0.0

    for x in data:
        total += x

    return total


# %%
summer(range(10))

# %% [markdown]
#  or finding a maximum:

# %%
import sys

def my_max(data):
    # Start with the smallest possible number
    highest = sys.float_info.min

    for x in data:
        if x > highest:
            highest = x

    return highest


# %%
my_max([2, 5, 10, -11, -5])


# %% [markdown]
# These operations, where we have some variable which is building up a result,
# and the result is updated with some operation, can be gathered together as a
# functional program, taking in (as an argument) the operation to be used to combine results:

# %%
def accumulate(initial, operation, data):
    accumulator = initial
    for x in data:
        accumulator = operation(accumulator, x)
    return accumulator

def my_sum(data):
    def _add(a, b):
        return a + b
    return accumulate(0, _add, data)


# %%
my_sum(range(5))


# %%
def bigger(a, b):
    if b > a:
        return b
    return a

def my_max(data):
    return accumulate(sys.float_info.min, bigger, data)

my_max([2, 5, 10, -11, -5])

# %% [markdown]
# Anyway, this accumulate-under-an-operation process is so fundamental to
# computing that it's usually in standard libraries for languages which allow
# functional programming:

# %%
from functools import reduce

def my_max(data):
    return reduce(bigger, data, sys.float_info.min)

my_max([2, 5, 10, -11, -5])


# %% [markdown]
# #### Efficient map-reduce
#
# Now, because these operations, `bigger` and `_add`, are such that e.g. (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) , i.e. they are **associative**, we could apply our accumulation
# to the left half and the right half of the array, each on a different computer, and then combine the two halves:
#
# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = (1 + 2) + (3 + 4)
#
# Indeed, with a bigger array, we can divide-and-conquer more times:
#
# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = ((1 + 2) + (3 + 4)) + ((5 + 6) + (7 + 8))
#
# So with enough parallel computers, we could do this operation on eight numbers
# in three steps: first, we use four computers to do one  each of the pairwise
# adds.
#
# Then, we use two computers to add the four totals.
#
# Then, we use one of the computers to do the final add of the two last numbers.
#
# You might be able to do the maths to see that with an N element list, the
# number of such steps is proportional to the logarithm of N.
#
# We say that with enough computers, reduction operations are O(ln N)
#
# This course isn't an introduction to algorithms, but we'll talk more about this
# O() notation when we think about programming for performance.
#
#

# ### Lambda Functions

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# When doing functional programming, we often want to be able to define a function on the fly:
#
#
#

# %%
def most_Cs_in_any_sequence(sequences):

    def count_Cs(sequence):
        return sequence.count('C')

    counts = map(count_Cs, sequences)
    return max(counts)


def most_Gs_in_any_sequence(sequences):
    return max(map(lambda sequence: sequence.count('G'), sequences))


data = [
    "CGTA",
    "CGGGTAAACG",
    "GATTACA"
]

most_Gs_in_any_sequence(data)

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# The syntax here means that these two definitions are identical:
#
#
#

# %%
func_name = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c

def func_name(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c


# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# The **lambda** keyword defines an "anonymous" function.
#
#
#

# %%
def most_of_given_base_in_any_sequence(sequences, base):
    return max(map(lambda sequence: sequence.count(base), sequences))

most_of_given_base_in_any_sequence(data, 'A')

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# The above fragment defined a lambda function as a **closure** over `base`. If you understood that, you've got it! 
#
#
#

# %% [markdown]
# To double all elements in an array:

# %%
data = range(10)
list(map(lambda x: 2*x, data))

# %%
[2*x for x in data]


# %% [markdown]
# Similarly, to find the maximum value in a sequence:

# %%
def my_max(data): 
    return reduce(lambda a, b: a if a > b else b, data, sys.float_info.min)

my_max([2, 5, 10, -11, -5])

# %% [markdown]
# ### Using functional programming for numerical methods

# %% [markdown]
#
# Probably the most common use in research computing for functional programming
# is the application of a numerical method to a function.
#
# Consider this example which uses the [`newton` function from SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.newton.html), a root-finding function implementing the [Newton-Raphson method](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NewtonsMethod.html). The arguments we pass to `newton` are the function whose roots we want to find, and a starting point to search from.
#
# We will be using this to find the roots of the function $f(x) = x^2 - x$.

# %%
# %matplotlib inline

# %%
from scipy.optimize import newton
from numpy import linspace, zeros
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

solve_me = lambda x: x**2 - x

for x0 in [2, 0.2]:
    answer = newton(solve_me, x0)
    print("Starting from {}, the root I found is {}".format(x0, answer))

xs = linspace(-1, 2, 50)
solved = [xs, list(map(solve_me, xs)), xs, zeros(len(xs))]

plt.plot(*solved)


# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# Sometimes such tools return another function, for example the derivative of their input function. This is what a naive implementation of that could look like:
#
#
#

# %%
def derivative_simple(func, eps, at):
    return (func(at + eps) - func(at)) / eps


# %%
def derivative(func, eps):

    def _func_derived(x):
        return (func(x + eps) - func(x)) / eps

    return _func_derived

straight = derivative(solve_me, 0.01)

# %% [markdown]
# The derivative of `solve_me` is $f'(x) = 2x - 1$, which represents a straight line.
# We can verify that our computations are correct, i.e. that the returned function `straight` matches $f'(x)$, by checking the value of `straight` at some $x$:

# %%
straight(3)

# %% [markdown]
# or by plotting it:

# %%
derived = (
    xs, list(map(solve_me, xs)),
    xs, list(map(derivative(solve_me, 0.01), xs))
)
plt.plot(*derived)
print(newton(derivative(solve_me, 0.01), 0))

# %% [markdown]
# Of course, coding your own numerical methods is bad, because the implementations you develop are likely to be less efficient, less accurate and more error-prone than what you can find in existing established libraries.
#
# For example, the above definition could be replaced by:

# %%
import scipy.misc

def derivative(func):
    def _func_derived(x):
        return scipy.misc.derivative(func, x)
    return _func_derived

newton(derivative(solve_me), 0)

# %% [markdown]
#
#
# If you've done a moderate amount of calculus, then you'll find similarities
# between functional programming in computer science and Functionals in the
# calculus of variations.
