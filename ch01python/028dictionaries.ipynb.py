# ## Dictionaries

# %% [markdown]
# ### The Python Dictionary

# %% [markdown]
# Python supports a container type called a dictionary.

# %% [markdown]
# This is also known as an "associative array", "map" or "hash" in other languages.

# %% [markdown]
# In a list, we use a number to look up an element:

# %%
names = "Martin Luther King".split(" ")

# %%
names[1]

# %% [markdown]
# In a dictionary, we look up an element using **another object of our choice**:

# %%
chapman = {"name": "Graham", "age": 48, 
           "Jobs": ["Comedian", "Writer"] }

# %%
chapman

# %%
chapman['Jobs']

# %%
chapman['age']

# %%
type(chapman)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Keys and Values

# %% [markdown]
# The things we can use to look up with are called **keys**:

# %%
chapman.keys()

# %% [markdown]
# The things we can look up are called **values**:

# %%
chapman.values()

# %% [markdown]
# When we test for containment on a `dict` we test on the **keys**:

# %%
'Jobs' in chapman

# %%
'Graham' in chapman

# %%
'Graham' in chapman.values()

# %% [markdown]
# ### Immutable Keys Only

# %% [markdown]
# The way in which dictionaries work is one of the coolest things in computer science:
# the "hash table". The details of this are beyond the scope of this course, but we will consider some aspects in the section on performance programming. 
#
# One consequence of this implementation is that you can only use **immutable** things as keys.

# %%
good_match = {
    ("Lamb", "Mint"): True, 
    ("Bacon", "Chocolate"): False
   }

# %% [markdown]
# but:

# %%
illegal = {
    ["Lamb", "Mint"]: True, 
    ["Bacon", "Chocolate"]: False
   }

# %% [markdown]
# Remember -- square brackets denote lists, round brackets denote `tuple`s.

# %% [markdown]
# ### No guarantee of order (before Python 3.7)

# %% [markdown]
#
# Another consequence of the way dictionaries used to work is that there was no guaranteed order among the
# elements. However, since Python 3.7, it's guaranteed that dictionaries return elements in the order in which they were inserted. Read more about [why that changed and how it is still fast](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39980744/1087595).
#
#
#

# %%
my_dict = {'0': 0, '1':1, '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4}
print(my_dict)
print(my_dict.values())

# %% [markdown]
# ### Sets

# %% [markdown]
# A set is a `list` which cannot contain the same element twice.
# We make one by calling `set()` on any sequence, e.g. a list or string.

# %%
name = "Graham Chapman"
unique_letters = set(name)

# %%
unique_letters

# %% [markdown]
# Or by defining a literal like a dictionary, but without the colons:

# %%
primes_below_ten = { 2, 3, 5, 7}

# %%
type(unique_letters)

# %%
type(primes_below_ten)

# %%
unique_letters

# %% [markdown]
# This will be easier to read if we turn the set of letters back into a string, with `join`:

# %%
"".join(unique_letters)

# %% [markdown]
# A set has no particular order, but is really useful for checking or storing **unique** values.

# %% [markdown]
# Set operations work as in mathematics:

# %%
x = set("Hello")
y = set("Goodbye")

# %%
x & y # Intersection

# %%
x | y # Union

# %%
y - x # y intersection with complement of x: letters in Goodbye but not in Hello

# %% [markdown]
# Your programs will be faster and more readable if you use the appropriate container type for your data's meaning.
# Always use a set for lists which can't in principle contain the same data twice, always use a dictionary for anything
# which feels like a mapping from keys to values.
