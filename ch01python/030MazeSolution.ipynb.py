# ### Solution: my Maze Model

# %% [markdown]
# Here's one possible solution to the Maze model. Yours will probably be different, and might be just as good.
# That's the artistry of software engineering: some solutions will be faster, others use less memory, while others will
# be easier for other people to understand. Optimising and balancing these factors is fun!

# Some important points:

# %% [markdown]
# * The whole solution is a complete nested structure.
# * I used indenting to make the structure easier to read.
# * Python allows code to continue over multiple lines, so long as sets of brackets are not finished.
# * There is an **empty** person list in empty rooms, so the type structure is robust to potential movements of people.
# * We are nesting dictionaries and lists, with string and integer data.
