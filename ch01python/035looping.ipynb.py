# ### Iteration

# %% [markdown]
# Our other aspect of control is looping back on ourselves.
#
# We use `for` ... `in` to "iterate" over lists:

# %%
mylist = [3, 7, 15, 2]

# %%
for whatever in mylist:
    print(whatever ** 2)

# %% [markdown]
# Each time through the loop, the variable in the `value` slot is updated to the **next** element of the sequence.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Iterables

# %% [markdown]
#
# Any sequence type is iterable:
#
#
#

# %%
vowels = "aeiou"
sarcasm = []

for letter in "Okay":
    if letter.lower() in vowels:
        repetition = 3
    else:
        repetition = 1

    sarcasm.append(letter * repetition)

"".join(sarcasm)

# %% [markdown]
# The above is a little puzzle, work through it to understand why it does what it does.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Â Dictionaries are Iterables

# %% [markdown]
# All sequences are iterables. Some iterables (things you can `for` loop over) are not sequences (things with you can do `x[5]` to), for example sets and dictionaries.

# %%
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()

founded = {"Eric": 1943, "UCL": 1826, "Cambridge": 1209}

current_year = now.year

for thing in founded:
    print(thing, " is ", current_year -  founded[thing], "years old.")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Unpacking and Iteration

# %% [markdown]
#
# Unpacking can be useful with iteration:
#
#
#

# %%
triples = [
    [4, 11, 15], 
    [39, 4, 18]
]

# %%
for whatever in triples:
    print(whatever)

# %%
for first, middle, last in triples:
    print(middle)

# %%
# A reminder that the words you use for variable names are arbitrary:
for hedgehog, badger, fox in triples:
    print(badger)

# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# for example, to iterate over the items in a dictionary as pairs:
#
#
#

# %%
things = {"Eric": [1943, 'South Shields'], 
          "UCL": [1826, 'Bloomsbury'], 
          "Cambridge": [1209, 'Cambridge']}

print(things.items())

# %%
for name, year in founded.items():
    print(name, " is ", current_year - year, "years old.")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Break, Continue

# %% [markdown]
#
# * Continue skips to the next turn of a loop
# * Break stops the loop early
#
#
#

# %%
for n in range(50):
    if n == 20: 
        break
    if n % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(n)


# %% [markdown]
# These aren't useful that often, but are worth knowing about. There's also an optional `else` clause on loops, executed only if you don't `break`, but I've never found that useful.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Classroom exercise: the Maze Population

# %% [markdown]
# Take your maze data structure. Write a program to count the total number of people in the maze, and also determine the total possible occupants.
